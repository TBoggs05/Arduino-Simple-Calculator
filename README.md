# Arduino-Simple-Calculator
The Calculator is capable of decimal and integer arithmetic using the operators: +,-,*,/. 

This simple calculator uses:
-Arduino UNO 
-BreadBoard
-4x4 keypad for input/output
-16x2 lcd display
-2 c++ files to handle the calculations

If you have an Arduino UNO at home, feel free to try making this on your own!

HOW TO BUILD FOR YOURSELF:
---------------------------------------------------
STEP 1: FOLLOW THE WIRING DIAGRAM BELOW:

-BELOW IS A WIRING DIAGRAM-
*NOTE: the capacitor can be replaced with a potentiometer for controllable contrast on the lcd panel.
*The wiring can also be chaged around to be cleaner, just make sure that the code is changed to reflect which pins are changed!

*Also Be aware about what the non-integer keys are mapped to:
A->/ B->* C->- D->+ #->= *->.

STEP 2: Using the Arduino IDE, follow along or copy/paste my code from the repo into your sketch!


STEP 3: Finally, upload to your Arduino UNO and you should have a working calculator!
